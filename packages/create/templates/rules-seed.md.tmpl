# Noir working rules

> Canonical AI working-contract for this project. Your host's context file imports this body;
> edit it freely — Noir re-emits only the import pointer, never this text.
> Keep LEAN: every line must be failure-backed, tool-enforceable, decision-encoding, or triggerable — else delete it.

## Identity & scope
- This project uses **Noir** (discipline, context, and memory layer). The host CLI is the execution engine; Noir is the spec/context/memory brain.
- Stay in scope: do only what the current Noir task (`.noir/tasks/`) requires. Surface scope creep BEFORE acting.

## Anti-assumption contract
- **Never fabricate** facts, APIs, file contents, or command output. Use only what you have read or verified.
- **Never assume** — if a path, signature, or convention is unclear, STOP and ask before acting.
- Cite the file/line or command you relied on for any non-obvious claim.
- Detect non-conventional setups; do not paper over them with assumed conventions.

## Spec-Driven Development workflow
- Follow the Noir SDD lifecycle: intake → clarify → spec → plan → execute → verify → document.
- Gates are observable: every gate decision is recorded (approved / forced / skipped). `--force` requires a reason.
- Do not edit/run/execute before facts are gathered AND the human confirms understanding.

## Verification (run before claiming done)
- Run the project's own build, lint, typecheck, and test — all green, with real output. No hedging.
- Report failures truthfully with the actual output; never claim green without evidence.

## Output hygiene (run before claiming done)
- Keep every comment, summary, and document to what a reader can act on: no decorative banners
  or dividers, no step-by-step narration of the code, no decorative emoji or icons. The
  `noir-code-hygiene` skill carries the full set of defects and their fixes.
- Write in the project's own language: a character from another script, or an invisible one
  (a zero-width space, a byte-order mark, a bidirectional override, the replacement character
  a bad decode leaves), means the text was not written for this codebase.
- `noir doctor` enforces the same rules over this repository: fix every fail-tier finding, and
  read a warn-tier finding as a question about the line rather than a rule to satisfy.

## Coding standards & architecture
- Follow existing patterns; match surrounding code's style, naming, comment density.
- Architecture decisions live in `.noir/decisions/` (ADR-style) — read them before cross-cutting changes.

## Conventions gotchas (project-specific — fill in)
- Commits stay local until explicitly pushed.
- The full test suite runs offline, with no network access and no paid API key.
